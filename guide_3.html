        <p>Once youâ€™ve watched the video turn to the right and enter the Gift Shop. Inside the Gift Shop look at the ceiling for a train running on a suspended track. Make a note of the colors you see on the train. Leave the Gift Shop and head back through the reception area into Security. Here you will find a locked door with a colored keypad. Push the colors that were on the train to open the door. The solution is:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Green.</li>
            <li>Pink.</li>
            <li>Yellow.</li>
            <li>Red.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>When you input the colors listed above you will unlock the door. Head through the door into the Security Office. Here we will get a few important items.</p>
