        <h1>Yellow Tape (Optional)</h1>

        <p>If you are interested in snagging all the VHS tapes there is one in the factory room where you get the Red hand. The Yellow Tape can be found on the second leaning shelf closest to the door. Walk behind the first shelf to snag it. The VCR to play it on is next to the stairs leading to the catwalk you pass when going up to the control panel.</p>

        <p>Once you’ve grabbed the Red hand (and VHS tape) we can now leave the Factory area. If you try to go back to the Lobby the way we came you wont be able to. Instead we need to use the newly unlocked Red hand. As you may have noticed in the room we got the Red hand from there is a conveyor belt with a door on it. Use both hands to open this door then walk down the belt until you slide to an area below.</p>
