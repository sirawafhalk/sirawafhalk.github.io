        <h1>Blue Tape Location and Getting Blue Hand</h1>

        <img src="https://cdn.holdtoreset.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/20125649/blue-tape-location-and-blue-hand-poppy-playtime-750x422.jpg" style="width:100%">

        <p>Walk into the Security Office and head over to the desk. Grab the Blue Tape by interacting with it and put it in the nearby Blue VCR. Watch the video on the tape. The tape introduces you to using the hands we will get. These hands are very important as they are used to solve most of the puzzles encountered during Chapter 1.</p>

        <p>When the video concludes the container holding the Blue hand will open. Approach the hand and interact with it to equip it on your character. You get a blue left hand to start with.</p>
