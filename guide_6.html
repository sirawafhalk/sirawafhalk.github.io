        <h1>Playtime Lobby</h1>

        <img src="https://cdn.holdtoreset.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/20130410/key-lobby-poppy-playground-750x422.jpg" style="width:100%">

        <p>Inside the lobby you will see a few interesting things. The first, and most prominent, is the large toy creature named Huggy Wuggy in the center of the room. Huggy Wuggy is the toy that chases you throughout this chapter. The second thing you will notice is that there are seven doors in this room. These doors lead to different areas of the factory.</p>

        <p>Before going through any of the doors we need to grab the Yellow Power Room Key dangling from the giant toys hand using your blue hand. To do this shoot the blue hand door to the left. The door wonâ€™t open because it has no power. When you do this the Yellow Key will drop into the creatures upraised hand. Use your hand to grab it.</h1>

        <p>Once you have the Yellow Key make your way to the door labelled Power. Go through the doors and into the Power generating room. Inside this room we need to get the power back up and running.</p>
