        <p>The Watch GT 3 does everything we want, from a smartwatch for casual athletes and even more. Finding issues with the wearable would be nitpicking - the display is bright, the battery lasts a long time, and the software features are as plentiful as they ever were. The watch looks elegant on the hand and is light enough to not get in the way. We would love to see the AI coach make it to other activities, and a wider choice of free watch faces.</p>
