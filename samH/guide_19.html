        <p>Samsung thankfully introduced wireless charging for its wearables some time ago, so no need for proprietary chargers - slap the Watch GT 3 on any Qi charger and you are good to go. It takes up to 3 hours for the entire cell to top up, but this is a number for our 46mm unit - the 42mm device should take under 2 hours. There is a small circular charger in the box if you don't have one of your own - it has the added benefit of being more compact and snapping magnetically to the back of the Watch GT 3. Verdict Samsung is taking hits from multiple sides, but we are happy to see it's not affecting its smart wearables at all.</p>
