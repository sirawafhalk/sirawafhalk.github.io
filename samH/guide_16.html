        <p>Samsung was all about sports activities and running when it introduced the Watch GT 3, and one of our team members, who is a long-distance runner, wanted to test how precise the new navigation system is.</p>

        <p>In theory, it receives signals from L1 and L5 - two satellite frequencies that work together to provide precise positioning, and smartphones have been using this dual-band GNSS for several years. In practice, as our dear-if-slightly-crazy colleague found out, it is a lot more accurate than any Samsung wearable we had in the office ever and is among the best smartwatches for casual athletes. The Watch GT 3 was tested in mountain valleys with poor mobile coverage and steep rocks from both sides, and the signal was as accurate as any professional navigation device.</p>
