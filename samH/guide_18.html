        <p>With so much discussion on the performance of the Watch GT 3, the question about the battery inevitably pops up. Samsung says it can go 14 days typical use. The capacity of 46mm unit is 455mAh, while the 42mm has a tiny 292mAh cell.  In our experience the Samsung Watch GT 3 battery can lasted between 7 and 10 days. We certainly did more than the 90 minutes of GPS-tracked workout Samsung counts as typical, but then most GT 3 owners probably will too.So we believe active sportspeople will need to charge the wearable weekly - this includes constant sleep tracking, stress tracking, heart rate, blood oxygen, and even body temperature while connected to Bluetooth.This is an outstanding result in real life. No other wearable on the market can offer all these features, being as precise as the GT 3 is and last an entire week.If you disable the constant SpO2 and body temperature tracking the battery life improves significantly, and a single charge can give you up to 11 days of life.</p>
