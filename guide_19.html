        <p>If you are interested in snagging all the VHS tapes there is one in the factory room where you get the Red hand. The Yellow Tape is located on the second leaning shelf closest to the door. Walk behind the first shelf to snag it. The VCR to play it on is next to the stairs leading to the catwalk you pass when going up to the control panel.</p>
