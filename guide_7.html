        <p>In the Power room head to the very end of the room to encounter a socket that is covered. Use the Blue hand to open this cover on the socket. Once the socket is open shoot the Blue hand onto the exposed socket. Hold the Blue hand there and walk around the two electricity conducting poles in the room leading back to the front. Doing this correctly turns the power back on.</p>

        <p>With the power back on head back to the lobby area. You will notice that Huggy Wuggy is gone. From this point on you will encounter this monster as you explore the other rooms of the building. Are next stop is through the Blue hand door we tried opening without there being power. Open it now and head through it. Go down the hallway and go through the door on your left. Walk down the dark hallway into the next area.</p>
