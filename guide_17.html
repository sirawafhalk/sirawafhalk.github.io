        <p>When the Personal Trainer works, it does a great job. It tells you when to slow down when to speed up, and if you are doing quick interval training, the navigation helps with the distance and timing to prevent the runner from overexertion. We would’ve loved to have this, at least for Trail Run as well. Still, we understand it is hard to calculate actual denivelation - the biggest variable when running in nature, therefore the Watch GT 3 cannot be as precise as on the track.We would suggest sticking to preparation for more popular distances, like your first 5K, 10K, half-marathon or full marathon distance - that’s where the Watch GT3 excels.</p>
